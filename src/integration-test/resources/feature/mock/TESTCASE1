Feature: Get List of actions based on the NameSpace
Scenario: As a user I want to get the list of actions available for the given namespace
* def path = '/api/v1/namespaces/'+nameSpace+'/actions?limit=30&skip=0'
Given url BaseUrl+path
And header Authorization = Auth
And header Content-Type = 'application/json'
When method get
Then status 200
And def json = response

The above example tests that the List Actions API's is returning a 200 ok . A lot more assertions can be put as per the requirements. Karate has some very good in built functions for
asserting the nested JSON's
